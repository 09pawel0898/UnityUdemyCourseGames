My goal during this course was to get as most knowlegde about the engine and external plugins as possible, not
to re-create all these games. Thus, im not going to complete all the course which is partially repeating the same steps.
I would practice the acquired knowledge in my own future projects.

Nevertheless I put in a lot of effort in these three titles, and expanded them with many new features, especially the Poco The Adventurer.
